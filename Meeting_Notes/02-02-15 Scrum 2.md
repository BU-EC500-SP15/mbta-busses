# Scrum 2 | 02-02-15 | 4:00 PM 

## Ata's Plan:

1st Sprint - Do visualizations with GTFS.
Until Week 5, we will work with GTFS data only (public data).
We use publicly available data.

2nd Sprint - Data Base Problem (Transit Master) to scrub out personal information.
Data ingestion from MBTA. We do not need the Transit Master data until Week 5.

3rd Sprint - Do some analytics with MapReduce and Hadoop.

4th and 5th Sprint - Visualizations and extra features based on what the MBTA guys
discuss.

Pay attention to the schedule of the route (15 key routes), GTFS.

## Outline

Solution concept:
- Draw a diagram with each layer from the previous Thursday meeting.
