# MBTA Bus Performance: Data Capture and Analysis Outline

https://docs.google.com/a/bu.edu/document/d/1Yow5tvJqMRiCaCxUQpYQptxXOEuehuKt91Y38R4DMbs/edit
 
### Vision and Goals of the Project:
MBTA Bus Performance is a project in collaboration with the MBTA staff to identify patterns, insights, and new uses for data that can provide analysis to support MBTA service-delivery. Goals of the project include:
- A scalable, incremental system that ingests and analyzes transit data, which updates at least once a day
- Visualization of MBTA data in the form of static map representations and bar graphs.
- Use the data from GTFS and Transit Master to compare key bus route travel time pre- and post-Key Bus Route Program (KBRP) project
- Observe trends in the data and try to understand the problems the MBTA key bus routes continue to experience
- Recommend solutions to the problems detected to make the buses run more efficiently
 
### Users/Personas of the Project
At first, the users will be MBTA personnel, but hopefully, the project will later be available to application developers, MBTA customers and MGHPCC contributing companies.

### User Story
As an employee of the MBTA, I want to better understand how the Key Bus Route Program improved the travel times of bus users, so that I can continue to improve the experience of our passengers.
 
### Scope and Features of the Project:
- Compare pertinent data pre- and post-KBRP to see how the changes impacted bus service. Specifically, we will be looking at these key areas:

--* Overall travel time for each trip for key routes
--* Incremental travel time for each trip (per station or every few stations)
--* Variation between scheduled arrival times and actual arrival times
--* Headway between buses
--* Average speed of key bus routes
--* Rate of passenger entries

- Visualization of the data. Must be clear and concise. It may also be interactive (if time permits).
 
### Solution concept:

A final report that includes several bar graphs and charts highlighting the differences between the pre- and post-KBRP data. The report will state which issues have been rectified, which are ongoing, and which new problems have been introduced.
In the report, recommendations to improve bus efficiency will be made.
 
### Acceptance criteria:

We should at a minimum complete the data analysis between the pre- and post-KBRP eras and present the differences in our final report. We should be able to identify which problems have been fixed and which ones persist.
 
### Release Planning: (We need to work on this)

Plans are on Trello board:
